# Customer-Segmentation-Classification
Customer Segmentation in an Automobile Company

In this dataset we will try to classify the customers of an automobile company into four groups.

Classification Algorithms used in this excercise:

1) Multinomial Logistic Regression
2) Naive Bayes
3) Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
4) Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
5) Decision Trees
6) Random Forest
7) Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Also, we will use feature engineering in order to improve our models' performance.
